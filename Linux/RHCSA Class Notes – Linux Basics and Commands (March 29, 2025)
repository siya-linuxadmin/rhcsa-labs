🧠 Key Principle:
“Know who you are, where you are, and what you want to do.”

👤 WHO YOU ARE
✅ whoami
Purpose: Shows the current logged-in username.


Use: Confirm which user you’re operating as.


✅ id
Purpose: Shows your UID, GID, and group memberships.


Use: See user and group ownership for permissions.


✅ who
Purpose: Lists all users currently logged into the system.


Use: Check who else is on the machine.


✅ w
Purpose: Shows logged-in users and what they are doing.


Includes: Idle time, login time, terminal, and running command.



📍 WHERE YOU ARE
✅ pwd
Purpose: Prints the current working directory.


Use: Helps you know where you are in the file system.


✅ cd /
Purpose: Takes you to the root directory.


Use: If you’re lost in the file system, this command resets your location to the top.



📁 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
✅ ls -l
Purpose: Long listing of files and directories (permissions, owners, size, time).


✅ ls -la
Purpose: Same as ls -l, but also shows hidden files (those starting with .).


✅ touch filename
Purpose: Creates an empty file.


✅ mkdir dirname
Purpose: Creates a new directory.



🧠 LINUX HISTORY & ARCHITECTURE
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free, open-source OS kernel.


It works with hardware and provides a platform for applications and commands.



🐧 The Shell
✅ env
Purpose: Shows environment variables (like PATH, HOME, SHELL).


Use: Understand how your session and commands are configured.


✅ /sbin/nologin
A shell that denies login access. Used to restrict users or service accounts.


✅ usermod -s /sbin/nologin username
Purpose: Set the shell of a user to /sbin/nologin.


Use: Disable login for a user without deleting them.



📀 MEMORY MANAGEMENT
✅ free -m
Purpose: Shows memory (RAM) usage in megabytes.


✅ free -g
Purpose: Shows memory usage in gigabytes.


✅ free -h
Purpose: Memory in a human-readable format (auto chooses MB/GB).


✅ What is Swap?
Swap is disk space used as "extra memory" when RAM is full.


It’s slower than RAM but helps prevent system crashes.



📍 DISK SPACE CHECKING
✅ df -h
Purpose: Shows disk usage of mounted filesystems in human-readable format.


✅ df -ht ext4
Purpose: Shows only ext4 filesystems in a human-readable format.



👤 USER LOOKUP
✅ cat /etc/passwd | grep siya
Purpose: Searches the list of system users for any entry with siya.


Use: Check if a user exists and see their login shell, home directory, UID/GID.



💻 First Time Using MobaXterm – SSH Access & User Management
✅ What is MobaXterm?
A Windows-based tool for terminal, SSH, and remote Linux access.


Used to connect to the remote system at IP 10.12.80.52.


✅ SSH Login:
ssh smith@10.12.80.52

Connected as user smith.


Host added to known hosts.


✅ Switched to Root:
su - root

✅ Created New User siya:
useradd siya
passwd *****

Set a short password (warning given, but accepted).


✅ Created Files:
touch class1 class2 class3 class4

Created 4 empty files.


✅ Verified Files:
ls
ll

Confirmed files were created with user siya as the owner.


❌ Connection Lost:
Read from remote host 10.12.80.52: Connection reset by peer

SSH session was disconnected.


❌ Tried Reconnecting:
ssh smith@10.12.80.52

Error: Connection timed out (server likely down or unreachable).



✅ Summary Recap:
Know who you are (whoami, id)


Know where you are (pwd, cd)


Know what you're doing (ls, touch, env)


Monitor system resources (free, df, w)


Manage users and shell access (usermod -s /sbin/nologin, cat /etc/passwd)


First-time use of MobaXterm for SSH into a remote Linux machine


User creation and file management using the terminal


Encountered SSH timeout and connection reset errors
